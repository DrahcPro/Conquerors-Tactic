# **Conqueror's Tactics**

<p>Conqueror's Tactics is a strategy game based around trust and betrayal.<br>
The concept of the game is: every player will be spawned at different spots on the map and will have to make allies to help them get to power and kill others. You have 3 lives and when all of those have been taken out, you are out of the game. The main currency in the game is tokens; these will be given on a daily basis and are required for all actions: move, upgrade, kill.
</p>
<p>There is one catch, there can only be one survivor, so you will have to betray your friends and allies at some point.
</p>

# **The Game Explained**

<p>There are multiple phases in the game, here the main ones explained.</p>
<br>

Startup
---
<p>The game starts with giving every player a position on the map, giving them one token, and starting the pay out per time unit (normally a token given per 24h)<br>
The idea for the players after finding their location is to make allies and start planning their way to victory, publicly or privately.
</p>

Beginning of the game
---
<p>When the first tokens will be given important plans can be made, who shall we start killing, who will we share tokens with, and who do we want to flee from. Shall we make friends on the other side of the map, or keep it close to home.
